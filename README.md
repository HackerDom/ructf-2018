# RuCTF 2018

RuCTF is an annual Russian Open Student Information Security Championship.

The contest is driven by classic rules (Attack-Defense CTF). Each team is given a set of vulnerable services. Organizers regulary fill services with private information â€” the flags. The goal of each team is to find vulnerabilities, fix them in their services and exploit them in order to get flags from other teams.

RuCTF 2018 was held on April 15, 2018 in the Ural Federal University, Russia, Yekaterinburg, Lenina, 51. [Results](https://ructf.org/2018/en/results/)
